<h2>Adaptation</h2>
<img src="../Images/ixobrychuscinnamomeus.jpg" align ="left"/><p>The most outstanding way that birds have adapted is , of course , the conversion of their upper limbs into wings , the growth of feathers & the ability to fly. Plumage is further adapted depending on habitat & habits. The feathers of cormorants & snakebirds get drenched to allow them to swim under water , but other birds effectively coat their feathers with oil from oil glands to waterproof them. Plumage & body shape is adapted for specialised flight. Owl feathers are so formed as to give slient flight. Built especially for speed is the Peregrine Falcon , which swoops on its prey from a great height. </p>

	<p>Colouring is also an important adaptation. Camouflage is seen for example in sandgrouse , snipe , bitterns , owls & nightjars. </p>

	<p>Teeth would weigh down the head of any bird wanting to fly efficiently , & also so over the past 100 million years birds have lost them & instead developed gizzards. The gizzard is situated near a bird's centre of gravity. Birds gulp in the muscular gizzard with the aid of grit & small stones the birds swallow. The ability to disgorge indigestible bones , fur , insect shells or large seeds in the form of pellets is another from of adaptation. </p>

	<p>Birds have developed specialised bills & feet for feeding. The most generalized bill perhaps belongs to the omnivorous crow. It is straight , pointed & roughly triangular in section. Birds like herons & kingfishers have more dagger-like bills , suitable for catching fish & frogs. Not all kingfishers need water for their fishing. One of the secrets of the White-breasted Kingfisher's ubiquity is that it can live on insects , lizards & other small terrestrial animals. Other accomplished fish-catchers like cormorants have 'tooth-edged' bill with they can grip fish. </p>

	<p>Dabbling ducks have widened bills with laminations on the edges of the upper & lower mandibles. This adaptation is especially necesary for plankton-sieving shovellers , & the larger spoonbills & flamingoes. Shore birds have thin , elongated bills for probing the mud in search for small animals. </p>

	<p>Birds of prey have developed deeper , shorter & down-curved bills for tearing & piercing flesh. But for them perhaps the most important piece of hunting equipment is their feet. They rely on the strength of their talons to kill. </p>

	<p>Most species of birds are animal-eating , but most animals eaten are small invertebrates , in particular insects. Birds like swallows , martins & nightjars catch insects on the wing wide gapes that scoop in their victims. Many other insects are caught on the plants on which they themselves feed. Small insectivorous birds like warblers have fine pointed beaks for collecting them. Woodpeckers , on the other hand , have strong , dagger-shaped bills , for chiselling wood & prising insects from crevices & beneath bark. </p>

	<p>Flowering plants also support a great number of birds , & just as birds have adapted to feeding on flowers , trees & planta too have adapted themselves to being fed on. In 1932 Salim Ali wrote on <i>Flower-Birds & Birds-Flower</i>. He listed as characteristics of the bird-flower that pollenisation is possible only through birds , that they have bright & conspicuous coloure (red being a bird's favourite) & no sent (as birds have a very poorly developed sense of smell) , but they do have an abundant supply of nectar. Typical bird-flowers of this sort can be seen on the spectacular silk-cotton tree <i>bombax malabaricum</i> , which is covered with waxy red or orange blooms around mid-February. Typical flower-birds are sunbirds , which have long , down-curved bills for drinking nectar. </p>

	<p>A much large number of bird species feeds on the fruit & seeds of plants & trees. Finches have stout beaks built for seed crushing , while barbets & fruit-eating thrushes both have large gapes for swallowing berries whole. </p>
