width=180 align=right border=0><h3>¤ Know The One-horned Rhinos</h3><p>The 
Indian Rhinoceros, internationally known as the Great Indian One Horned 
Rhinoceros is a colossally built beast of truly mammoth proportions that is next 
only to the Indian Elephant. Though it could once be found throughout India in 
the grassy flood plains of the Indus, Ganga and Brahmaputra rivers, it is now 
confined to the banks of the Brahmaputra, for its natural habitat of marshes, 
grassland and swamps has constantly been turned into 
farmland.</p><h3>¤ Physical Features</h3><p>The Indian rhinoceros ("rhino") has 
one horn, and it has skin with loose folds which make it appear armored. A 
single One -Horned Rhino are about 1.5 to 1.8 m tall. The female Indian rhino 
weighs 1600 kg (3500 lb); male: 2200 kg (4800 lb).<h3>¤ Key 
Factors</h3><p><B>Class :</B> Mammalia<BR><B>Zoological Name : 
</B>Rhinoceros unicornis<BR><B>Status :</B> Endangered<BR><B>Major Sites :</B> 
Kaziranga National Park, Manas National Park in India.</p> 
<h3>¤ Social Characteristics</h3><p>The 
one-horned rhino is solitary in nature and spends hours wallowing in mud and 
water, or feeding on grasses. It feeds mostly in the morning and evening. It 
generally restricts its movements within an area of 5 sq km, though the males 
may sometimes move further in search of mates. One of their special features is 
the long noisy fights that occur between a male and a female at the time of 
courtship. Violent encounters ensue in a series of displays and postures 
involving curling of lips, and snorts and grunts. Rhinos can be amazingly agile 
despite their bulk and growth, and can charge at speeds of 4 to 8 km per hour. </p>
<h3>¤ Habitat &amp; Diets</h3><IMG height=149 alt="Indian Rhino" hspace=0 
src="../images/indianrhino3.jpg" 
width=180 align=right border=0><p>The Indian rhino has been recorded from a number 
of habitats, including marshy lowland and reedbeds; tall grass or bush with 
patches of savanna and occasional streams and swamps; thick tree and scrub 
riverine forest; and dry, mixed forest. Some of this ecological flexibility may 
be due to seasonal preferences and some to pressure from development which 
forces the rhino into suboptimal habitat.</p><p>The Indian rhino mainly eats 
grass, reeds and twigs. It uses its prehensile upper lip to browse tall grass 
and shrubs. It can fold the tip away when feeding on short grass. Woody browse 
comprises about 20% of its diet during the winter. In some localities it feeds 
in cultivated areas. </p><h3>¤ Indian Rhinos &amp; Conservation</h3><p>The 
population of the one-horned rhino has decreased due to destruction of their 
natural habitat as well as uncontrolled and merciless poaching, for the mythical 
aphrodisiacal properties of its horn, as well as mythical medicinal properties 
of other parts of its body. One rhino horn can fetch as much as 20,000 US 
dollars, and even more in the international markets.<p><h3>¤ Major 
Sites</h3><p>Indian Wildlife Authorities are now making a determined effort at 
rhino conservation. Translocation Projects are under operation, and the survival 
of the rhinos at all odds is the final goal. The Great Indian One Horned 
Rhinoceros can be found in the national reserves of Kaziranga 
National Park, Manas National Park and Jaldapara.</p>
