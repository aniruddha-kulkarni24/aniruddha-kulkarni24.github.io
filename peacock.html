<h2>Peacock</h2>
<IMG height=149 alt=Peacock hspace=0

width=180 align=right border=0><h3>¤ Know the Peacock</h3><p>Peacocks, 
commonly called peafowl (peacock refers to the male), are large pheasants, 
family Phasianidae, of the Indian-Asian region. They are found in dry forests, 
mostly in small groups containing of one male and several females. Peafowl 
rarely fly; instead, they run from danger. True peafowl include the blue 
peacock, Pavo cristatus, of India and Sri Lanka, and the green peacock, P. 
muticus, of Burma and Indochina. A rare and aberrant form, the Congo peacock, 
Afropavo congensis, is found only in forests of the Congo basin in 
Africa.</p><h3>¤ Mythological Significance</h3><p>The peafowl is prominent in 
the mythology and folklore of the Indian people. The Hindus consider the bird to 
be sacred because the god Kartikeya (son of the Lord Shiva and Parvati and 
brother to the god Ganesh) rides on its back. Legends hold that the peafowl can 
charm snakes and addle their eggs. Peacock always accompanies the images of Lord 
Krishna. And the beautiful peacock feather is also part of Lord Krishna's crown. 
</p><p>The peacock finds reference in the Greek myth, in the bible, and was 
known to the pharaoh of Egypt and to the 14th century Europe, where it was 
roasted and served to in its own plumage. </p><h3>¤ Physical 
Features</h3><p>The male Indian Peafowl, commonly known as the peacock, is one 
of the most recognisable birds in the world. These large, brightly colored birds 
have a distinctive crest and an unmistakable ornamental train. The train 
(1.4-1.6 meters in length) accounts for more than 60% of their total body length 
(2.3 meters). Combined with a large wingspan (1.4-1.6 meters), this train makes 
the male peafowl one of the largest flying birds in the world. The train is 
formed by 100-150 highly specialized uppertail-coverts. Each of these feathers 
sports an ornamental ocellus, or eye-spot, and has long disintegrated barbs, 
giving the feathers a loose, fluffy look. When displaying to a female, the 
peacock erects this train into a spectacular fan, presenting the ocelli to their 
best advantage. 
The more subtly coloured female Peafowl is mostly 
brown above with a white belly. Her ornamentation is limited to a prominent 
crest and green neck feathers. Though females (2.75-4.0 kg) weigh nearly as much 
as the males (4.0-6.0 kg), they rarely exceed 1.0 meter in total body 
length.</p><h3>¤ Social Characteristics</h3><p>Peacock or peafowl Large bird 
belonging to the pheasant family, in East Asia being its native region. The 
crested common peacock during courtship displays his elongated upper tail which 
converts into a magnificent green and gold erectile train adorned with green 
blue " eyes " before the duller plumaged peahen. The peacock is a ornamental 
bird and is of quarrelsome nature and does not mix well with other domestic 
animals. </p><h3>¤ Habitat &amp; Diet</h3><p>
They are omnivorous, obtaining most of their food by scratching the 
leaf litter with their strong feet. Indian Peafowl do most of their foraging in 
the early morning and shortly before sunset. They retreat to the shade and 
security of the forest for the hottest portion of the day. Foods include grains, 
insects, small reptiles, small mammals, berries, drupes, wild figs, and some 
cultivated crops.</p>

India</h3><p>The Indian peacock, Pavo cristatus (Linnaeus), the national 
bird of India, is a colourful, swan-sized bird, with a fan-shaped crest of 
feathers, a white patch under the eye and a long, slender neck. </p><h3>¤ Major 
Sites</h3><p>The Indian Peafowl occurs from eastern Pakistan through India, 
south from the Himalayas to Sri Lanka. Though once common in Bangladesh, it may 
now be extinct in that country. In its native India, the peafowl is a creature 
of the open forests and riparian undergrowth. In southern India, it also prefers 
stream-side forests but may also be found in orchards and other cultivated 
areas.</p><h3>¤ Peacock &amp; Conservation</h3><p>The 
peacock is widely found in the Indian sub-continent from the south and east of 
the Indus river, Jammu and Kashmir, east Assam, south Mizoram and the whole of 
the Indian peninsula. The peacock enjoys immense protection. It is fully 
protected under the Indian Wildlife Protection) Act, 1972. </p><p>This long and 
close association with humans has proven the peafowl’s adaptability to 
human-altered landscapes. This species does not appear to need any additional 
legal protection or conservation attention.</p>
