<p>This wondrous land India, is a haven of flora, fauna and avifauna. The legacy of bountiful wild animals includes 550 mammals, 30,000 insects and 2000 species and sub-species of birds, with over 500 species of reptiles and amphibians including the deadly king cobras, pythons, crocodiles and monitor lizards. Due to its diverse topography and varying climatic conditions, India is the second largest country on the planet to have such diverse life forms.<br>
In order to protect the several endangered species, an endeavour to strike a balance between ecology and tourism is essential.
Here is your chance to unravel the mysteries of Indian wildlife. </p>

<h3>¤ Mammals</h3>
<p>India being a tropical country has an amazing diversity of vegetation and wildlife. Here are some images of the wild for your viewing pleasure. </p>

<p>Wildlife travel facilitates in viewing the majestic Indian tiger in its natural habitat. Perceived as an icon of strength, speed and agility, the tiger and shades of its existence can be seen finely woven into the local culture and tradition. In this section, we bring you the other side of this regal animal – which is quite fascinating ! </p>

<h3>¤ Bishnoli - The Real Animal People</h3>
<p>The Thar Desert supports a surprising variety of hardy plants and wildlife. The fact that they have managed to survive in the harsh terrain is purely because of the people of the state, especially the Bishnoi tribals. This tribe follows the 29 sutras laid down by their guru, believe in complete non-violence towards all living organisms, and have even sacrificed their own lives to protect trees and animals from poachers. </p>

<h3>¤ The Philosophy of Indian Co-Existence </h3>

<p>Wildlife has survived in India thanks to the religions and philosophies that have guided Indians over the centuries. Indians have an attitude that encourages co-existence with wildlife. This is especially true of tribals who have the greatest interaction with wildlife. It is quite evident that the message of conservation is intricately woven into every aspect of Indian culture. </p>

<h3>¤ Wildlife Sanctuaries</h3>
<p>India has a wealth of about 80 National Parks and 441 sanctuaries. Many of the wildlife sanctuaries and a few national parks have been established in erstwhile private hunting reserves of the British Raj and Indian aristocracy. often, a park is better known for a particular animal. Travel to Gir National Park in Gujarat, famous for its Asiatic lions, the Indian rhinoceros is the pride of Kaziranga (Assam), elephants steal the show in Periyar (Kerala), and tigers are synonymous with Kanha (Madhya Pradesh) and Bandavgarh (Madhya Pradesh). The mangrove forests of Sunderbans are the unique habitat of the Royal Bengal Tiger.. </p>
