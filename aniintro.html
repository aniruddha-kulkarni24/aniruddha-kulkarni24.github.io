<h3><b>¤ Wild Life Introduction:</h3></b><p>
Indian is unique in having immense natural beauty is its 
different lions and in possessing a rich and diverse wild life 
fauna Indian wild life is incomparable in its variety for 
example, the tiger, the lion and the leopard room about in the 
same country elephants and the one horned rhinoceros are 
found here in abundance.</p><p>
India has more types of the graceful deer and cats than any 
other country in the world. In facts, India includes more than 
120 families of terrestrial vertebrates. 
It has been estimated that there are more than 400 species of 
mammals, 1200 species of Birds, more than 350 Species of 
Reptiles and more that 29,70,000 species of insects in India.
The tiger, India's national animal, is a symbol that is an intrinsic part of our
culture. One of the earliest portrayals of the tiger in India is found in the
Harappan seals from the Indus valley culture, dating back to 2500 BC, which
depict an intricate association between people and tigers.</p><p>
Human welfare and economic development in Asia depends on the same
clean water, clean air, natural flood controls and other forest resources that
tigers need. Tigers are an umbrella species, if we can maintain healthy tiger
populations in India, we can ensure that there are healthy habitats and prey
populations present to support them.</p><p>
India is one of the thirteen tiger range countries and has the largest number
of source sites with wild tigers. The Indian government has always made Tiger
protection a priority and Project Tiger, launched in the early seventies, has put
the endangered tiger on a definite path to recovery. As far as the scale of
implementation and the diverse habitats under its coverage are concerned, the
project has no parallel in the contemporary world.</p><p>

To an average citizen in India, it is difficult to understand why wildlife conservation should be important.
Conservation of wild life is an essential component of environmental rejuvenation. India with a diversified
climate has provided a magnificent spectrum of nature spread over 329 million hectares of geographical
area. Since the wildlife is the mirror of the health of the environment, its protection is of paramount
importance. Today the grim situation in India is elucidated by the fact that only about 359 <b>Asiatic lions
(Panthera leo), 1,411 tigers (P.tigris), 27,694 (2007-08) elephants (Elephas maximus) </b>are reported according
to the 2008 census. Denudation of natural habitats and large scale deforestation apart from poaching in the
South Asian sub-continent has been mainly responsible for this grim situation.</p><p>

<h3><b>Conservation Measures:</h3></b><p>

•For the preservation of species wild life management staff should have a correct idea about the exact habitat which the species under consideration needs.<br>
•Natural habitat of wild animals should be carefully protected.<br>
•Shooting and hunting of endangered species should be totally banned.<br> 
•Habitats of wild life should be improved by constructing water holes, saltlicks and by raising plantation of better and nourishing fodder grasses and trees.</p><p> 


<h3><b>Modes Of Wild Life Conservation:</h3></b><p>

•Protected species of Indian wild life are here they are, white eyed buck, black buck, Four horen antelope, golden cat, snow leopard, great Indian bustard, Monitor lizard, winter lizard, leathery turtle, marsh crocodile etc.</p> 


<h3><b>Reasons For Depletion Of Wild Life:</h3></b><p>

•Destruction of wild plants of forests for timber, charcoal and firewood often deprives wild animals their most palatable food and affects their survival.<br> 
•Absence of covers or shelter to wild animals. <br>
•Noise pollution by different transport media and polluting river water have adversely affected wild animals.<br>
•Hunting methods of all kinds and for any purpose (that is, food, recreation, fur, plumage, tusk, horn etc.) have caused destruction of wild life.<br> 


<h3><b>The Tiger Dance Celebration:</h3></b>

<p>All along the coastline in Southern India, there is a tradition of Tiger dance. To celebrate the birth of Lord Krishna on Janmashtami in these areas men of all ages paint themselves with black stripes over a yellow base, wear tiger masks and dance in the streets. In some areas, like the small town of Udipi in Karnataka, special tiger dancing contests are held and the winners are awarded handsome prizes. One wonders what prompted this strange tradition in these areas, perhaps the desire to be like a tiger – strong, clever and agile. </p>

<h3><b> The Belief of North-East Naga Tribes:</h3></b>

<p>In the north-east region of the country, Nagas believe that both man and the tiger are sons of the same mother. Although siblings, one took birth in the shape of a man and the other in the form of the striped tiger. Man stayed at home while the tiger went to the jungle. Later, due to some reason, the brothers were forced to fight against each other. Man forced the tiger to jump into the river and killed him. Floating downstream, the animal body was discovered by the Naga God, who sat on it for 10 years and gave birth to hundreds of tigers. </p>

<p>All over its habitat, tiger and shades of its existence can be seen finely woven with the local culture and tradition. All over, one comes across thousands of anecdotes about the beast; both inspiring and terrifying. All over India one can find images, statues, and paintings of the tiger, yet this beautiful animal is in constant danger from the human race whose inborn nature is to defy while admiring. </p>

<h3><b> Save Tiger:</h3></b>

<p>Why should a species that is always blood-thirsty be conserved? Why should huge government and international funds go in for the safety of the tiger when so many human lives are living in poverty and misery. The answer to the question is not as simple as it seems. For sure, the lives of fellow human beings are precious, but the survival of the tiger is no less important. <br>

Unfortunately we, the human beings do not live in isolation. Unfortunately we co-exist in an intense network of species and sub-species. The human beings evolved as a result of evolutionary process that started millions of years ago. From a small, ‘semi-living’, unicellular organism millions of years ago we evolved into what we are today. No doubt we are the most developed and powerful of all the species, but unfortunately even today we are dependent on other species for our daily requirements. Unfortunately all the species, animals or plants, are similarly dependent on each other for their survival. </p>

<p>We are all small but important parts of the larger system that keeps us feeding and multiplying. Indian Tiger is also a small but important part of this system. If not for the tiger, it is for our own selfishness that we have to keep a important part of the system alive. For example…the tiger feeds on the herbivorous animals, thereby help keeping their population under control and indirectly saving the jungle from overgrazing. It also feeds on the sick, old and injured animals, thereby helping to keep its prey species healthy. There are hundreds of obvious and not so obvious ways in which the tiger is helps the larger system work. </p>

<p>However powerful and intelligent we human beings may be, we cannot ‘create’ life. We can’t even forcefully order a species to multiply. The two sub-groups of Indian Bengal tigers are already extinct. Once the last pair of tigers on the planet die, how much ever we want, desire or try, we will never be able to ‘create’ another tiger. </p>
