<h2>Habits</h2>
<img src="../Images/parakeet.jpg" align ="left"/><p>Breeding is related very much to food supply. As large areas of the Oriental region provide more adundent food to more birds for a larger period than in more temperate zones , this means the breeding period can be longer. </p>

	<p>Large birds of prey breed between October & March , while large water birds like storks , cormorants , egerts & ibis , nest in colonies during the monsoon. This is also the period when munias & weaver birds breed. The peak breeding season for other common birds is February to May , although hill birds nest even later. </p>

	<p>During the breeding season males of many species produce long & complicated sounds called birdsong. <br>
Songs must be differentiated from the calls that birds of both sexes make throughout the year which are much simpler & used in a variety of circumstances , for examples to express alarm , to threaten , to beg for food & so on . It should also be distinguishes from the mechanical noises birds make , clattering of the bill or clapping of the wings , for similar reasons. </p>

	<p>Once you are familiar with the song of a particular species , it is possible to identify it immediately by its voice. Not surprisingly , birds too use song to identfy themselves to one another , & to attract mates. In species which aggressively defend a territory , it is still debatable how much song is used simply to attract females , & to what degree it serves to demarcate the male's domain. The matter is complicated further by the fact that females are probably most attracted by the male with the largest territory. The size of territory varies enormously. In species which breed in colonies , it extends just a few feet around the nest. </p>

	<p>If song is important in finding the mate , so are courtship displays. The peacock is blessed with a powerful through unmellifluous voice  , but makes up for this by the male's unmatched courtship display. The peacock stamps & turns with his tail outspread before a number of females. Even birds which pair for life are known to display. In the breeding season Sarus Cranes frequently break into a shrinking dance , spreading their wings , lowering their heads & leaping into the air , trumpeting loudly all the while. Other birds indulge in less spectacular rituals , like making gifts of food to one another. </p>

	<p>Courtship culminates in mating , with the male mounting the female.  The male's tests are internal & make up only a  tiny fraction of the bird's bodyweight , as little as  0.005 percent , outside the breeding season . During the breedin season the tests increase up to a thousandfold in weight. In most birds there is a small erectile phallus , but this is well developed & protrusible in only a few species like ducks & geese. The female's overies are also contained in her body cavity , & fertilisation of an egg generally takes place once it leave the overy & passes down towards the shell gland where the outer layer of the egg become calcified to form the shell. Most females can store live spream in their body & so fertilisation can take place some time after mating. </p>

	<p>Eggs are laid in the nest the pair has previously prepared. These vary from rough scrapes in the ground , as with plovers , to the holes in rivers banks tunnelled by kingfishers , the large untidy nests of vultures , & the elaborate nests of weaver birds often seen suspended in groups of ten or more from palms & other trees. The male weaver bird is a master of the nest-building art. Each male of a colony laboriously tears off strips of grass or complete with entrance tunnel & egg chambers. When & set up house in whichever nest takes their fancy. When the nest is complete & the egg laid , the male takes off to build another nest & attract another female. </p> 

	<p>Hornbills nest in holes in trees & are unique in imprisoning the female within the nest behind a mud wall , leaving open a gap just large enough for the male to pass her food. Not all birds form pairs. Some babblers breed commonally with differnt females laying eggs in the same nest. </p>		

	<p>Eggs also vary in size , colour , shape  & number. Those which require camouflage are well-motted , although most are pigmented. Cuckoos parasitic on other's nests lay eggs which resemble those of the host species. In the case of Hawk-Cuckoos & Pied Creasted Cuckoos , these are babblers. </p> 

	<p>Hatchlings require different amounts of care from their parents. Songbirds chicks , for example , are born naked , while gamebirds are born with feathers & are soon running  after their parents. Most young birds have characteristic beging behaviour , & in many species parents have been observed to give them a diet richer in protein than their own normal diet , to promote their offspring's growth. </p> 

	<p>As the young gain their full plumage , the adults generally begin to moult. Feathers are shed & re-grown in a distinct pattern , generally beginning with the first flight feathers & ending with the replacement of the last. Moulting is necessary as feathers do wear out. Species which have distinct breeding & non-breeding plumage moult twice a year , while in large birds , such as eagles , a moult may take two there years to complete, In short , individual birds shed feathers according to their needs. Migratory birds , for example , never moult at time of migration. </p>
