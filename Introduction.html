<h2>Introduction</h2>
<img src="../Images/parrot.jpg" align ="left"/><p>The Indian region is incredibly rich in birdlife. Over 1200 of the world's 8650 species of birds are found in  the region. This number rises to over 2000 with sub species included ,  which makes the Indian check-list twice the sizes of the those of Europe & North America. This abundance is due to sea level to the peaks of the Himalaya , the world's highest mountain range ; rainfall from its lowest in the Rajasthan desert to its highest in the north-eastern town of Cherrapunji in Meghalaya , one of the wettest places in the world. Unlike more temperate zones , the climate of large areas of the Indian region encourages continuous plant growth & insect activity--abundant sources of avian nourishment throughout the year. </p>
	
	<p>The peoples of the region have lived for thousands of years in close contact with its rich natural life .The earliest Hindu religious work , the <i>Rig Veda</i> , refers to same twenty species of birds , but its anonymous cmpilers must have been familiar with many more. Legends & myths grew around certain familiar species. The Brahminy Duck , for for life , separating from one another at night to feed but keeping in contact by calls , & then reuniting at down. The <i>chtaka</i> , either the Hawk Cuckoo or the Pied Crested Cuckoo , was said to drink only rainwater , no matter how thirsty it was. The Sanskrit poet kalidasa , frequently  uses bird imagery in his plays & poetry. His <i>Meghdoot</i> is a sensuous poem about a lower exiled from his beloved in the monsoon , traditionally the season for passion & romance among humans , & in fact the time when large water birds like storks , cormorants , egrets & cranes breed. Addressing a storm cloud the lower says , </p>

		<h4 align="center">hen-cranes will know the time ripe for mating <br>
		& rejoice when they note in the sky <br>
		your eye-delighting presence ; rest assured<br>
		they will attend on you in patterned flight .</h4> 

	<p>Not only poets , rulers too , expressed interest in ornithology. The great Mughals maintained royal menageries & revelled in hunting on a grand scale. But they were also meticulous in their obsevations of wildlife.<br>
In the 16th century , Babar , the first Mughal Emperor , observed his first Pied Myna. </p>
	
	<p>When I threw a bridge over the Ganges & crossed it , driving the enemy before me , I saw in Lucknow , Oudh & these countries a species of <i>sharak</i> which a black back. I had never seen it before. This  species probably does not learn to speak at all. </p> 

	<p>Babar's keen interest in nature was inherited by his son Humayun , who even when fleeing india after being defected by an Afghan invader , stopped to have a painting made of a bird of a type he had never seen before which happened to fly into his tent. The Emperor Jehangir noted with amazement the devotion of a Sarus Crane to its dead mate. The bird refused to leave the bones of its spouse , & when ,  weak & dying , it was lifted from the remains , worms & maggots were found to have dug  into its brest. </p>

	<p>The Mughal empire began to disintegrate at the beginning of the 18th century , & the spread of British power gave enormous scope to officers in the police , civil , forest & armed services to obseve the region's plantiful bird life. As British power grew , these were increasing numbers of such officers , whose jobs required much less crippling paperwork than those of their successors today. The result was the pioneering work of Brain Hodgson , TCJerdon & Edward Blyth , often called the founders of Indian ornithology. Jerdon's Birds of India, published in 1862 , was based on the work of all three men , assisted by a loyal group of field workers. </p>

	<p>The next major advance in ornithological knowledge came with the arrival of Allan O Hume--perhaps more widely known as a founder of the India National Congress. For over a decade he & his team collected birds for study over most of the Indian region. Hume also collected , edited & published eleven volumes of bird observations between 1872 & 1888. These volumes , collectively  known as Stray Feathers, are valuable reference works even today. </p>

	<p>A year after the last Stray Feathers was published , WT Blandford & Eugene W Oates produced the first volume of  Fauna of British India. Three more volumes were published in the following nine years. These were the most significant reference works on Indian ornithology for at least twenty years. They included detailed observations from parts of the Indian region uncovered by previous work. </p>

	<p>The next major work was by EC Stuart Baker , an Indian police officers for nearly twenty years , whose energetic enthusiasm for ornitholoy played an important role in popularising this branch of natural history study in India. In 1898 he joined the Bombay  Natural History Society (BNHS) , which had been gaining members & authority steadily since it was founded in 1883. Some of Baker's classic early work appeared first in the journal of the BNHS , including Game Birds of India. But Baker's most notable works are the eight bird volumes of the second edition of  Fauna of British India, published between 1922 & 1930 , & the  Nidification of Birds of the Indian Empire, published between 1932 & 1935. </p>

	<p>The twentieth century saw an increasing number of talented & dedicated ornithologists in India--but the  most calebrated & long lasting ornithological partnership was between Salim Ali & Dillon Ripley. Salim Ali's interest in birds resulted from a boyhood visit to the office of the Bombay Natural History Society with the corpse of a strange bird which he had shot. As he himself recalls <br> 
	This must have been somewhere in 1908 , & my first contact with the BNHS which was to become such an important element in the shaping of my life & career. All my nervousness vanished completely in the face of the charming kindliness... of Mr Millard [the Honorary Secretary]. I then realized that perhaps ALL white men were not the dogs our youthful fancy had painted them...I fumbled out my credentials & the little paper packet containing the mystery bird. He identified it at a glance as a Yellowthroated Sparrow , & bid me follow him to the reference cabinets...He patiently opened drawer after drawer for me to see the hundreds of different birds found in the Indian Empire , & I believe it was at this moment that my curiosity about birds really clicked. </p>

	<p>The Yellowthroated Sparrow showed salim Ali his way forward in life & in 1944 he met a young US army man in transit through  Bombay , who was to be his colleague , fellow-ornithologist & explorer. Dillon Ripley & Salim Ali planned ornithological field-trips for the post-war years , the first to be achieved being a journey to the Mishmi Hills in the extreme north-east of Assam. It was on this trip that they conceived the idea of their Handbook of the Birds of India & Pakistan.The first step towards compiling a handbook was an up-to-date checklist , provided by Ripley's A Synopsis of the Birds of India & Pakistan published by the BNHS in 1961. The first volume of the Handbook was published in 1968 , & the tenth & last in 1974 , four days after Salim Ali's seventy-eighth birthday. </p>


	<p>The Handbook , listing 2060 birds , remains the standard & most exhaustive work on Indian birds as such , which is why in this photoguide we have kept to Dillon Ripley's numbering system. What this guide aims to provide for the first time is a valuable aid to field identification through photographic illustrations of a large number of the region's birds. </p>


<h3>Oriental & Sub-regions</h3>
	<p>In the 19th century , PL Sclater studied the world's birds & divided the planet into six bio-geographic realms. This was later slightly modified to apply to all animals. The Oriental realm covers South & South East Asia , the Himalaya separating it from the Palearctic to the north. Leafbirds are found exclusively in this region & broad-bills nearly so. In general the region's birds have closest affinities with those of tropical Africa. </p>

	<p>The Indian sub-region has further been divided into seven different areas , in which different types of birds are found. </p>

	<p>The northernmost of these areas in the Himalaya, which form an arc some 2500 kilometres long & 150 to 400 kilometres broad across the top of the sub-continent. The Himalayan mountains from roughly three parts , the foothills or Sivaliks to the south , the Himachal , or lower mountains , & the Himadri or high Himalaya to the north. The Ladakh plateau , with an average elevation of 5300 metres , occupies a large portion of the Indian state of Jammu & Kashmir & consists of steppe country with mountain lakes where birds like the Bar-headed Goose & Brown-headed Gull breeds in summer. The state of Himachal Pradesh , & the Kumaon & Garhwal regions of the state of Uttar Pradesh lie to the west of Nepal , which falls almost entirely within the central Himalaya. Further east the rainfal increases giving the Eastern Himalaya of Bhutan & Sikkim a very different range of species from those in the west. </p>

	<p>The North West covers the bulk of Pakistan , the flat plains of the Indian Punjab & the semi-arid & arid plains of Rajasthan in the west. The Panjab (divided now between India & Pakistan) is watered by the five rivers , after which it takes its name , & efficient farming on fertile soil means that it produces an immense surplus of wheat & rice. Further west , wherever irrigation has been possible the desert has bloomed. Mountains of red chillies , for example , can been seen drying next to the fields around Jodhpur , while there are verdent paddy filds in areas irrigated by the great River Indus in Pakistan's sindh province. Areas without irrigation have to rely on the perennially deficient rainfall , but local grasses have adapted to this , & after a monsoon shower even the desert sprouts rich pasture. Much of the area is in fact thorn scrub  rather than desert. Among the numerous desert birds found in this area are many which are related to specues further west. The shifting sands of the desert join ultimately with the Rann of Kutch , a large salt waste which runs into the sea , & are bordered to the south-east by the Aravallis , India's most ancient mountains. </p>

	<p>North India comprises the Gangetic plain , enriched by thousands of years of alluvial deposits brought by the River Ganga & her tributaries from the Himalaya. The Gangetic plain is densely populated & highly fertile. This region extends up to an altitude of 1000 metres in the north , which also means it includes the low foothills of the Himalaya , & the terai of India & Nepal , once a marshy area covered with dence forest. Much of the terai area has been cleared for farming  but some of the forests which still exist reveal the fantastic variety  of birdlife which these forests must once have supported. </p>

	<p>Peninsular India, bordered on the north-west by the Aravallis & the Vindhya mountains , on the west by the Arabian Sea & the east by the Bay of Bengal , makes up the largest physiographic division of India. The central plateaus of this area , which is also known as the Deccan , rise to over 1000 metres in the south , but hardly exceed 500 metres in the north. The peninsula has some wonderful landscapes , hills & hugh boulders littering the countryside , & large areas  of forest. Great rivers like the Narmada rise in the heart of the peninsula & flow into the sea. The steep escarpments of the western Ghats , the mountains which stand between the plateau &  the low-lying coastal strip , catch the full force of the monsoon. </p>

	<p>The South West region lies within the peninsula , but due to the particularly humid climate & the height of the hills here , its birds , like spiderhunters & laughing thrushes bear strong affinities with those found in the north-east & Burma. The highest of the hills here are the Nilgiris or Blue Mountains , much of whose characteristic download & shola forest is now under eucalyptus , tea & other plantation crops. Tea is also the main crop of the Annamalai or Elephant Mountains of Kerala , while cardamon & other species are grown lower down. Perhaps the most ornithologically fascinating part of this area are the forests of the Wynad , where Kerala , Karnataka & Tamil Nadu meet. </p>

	<p>The north east & Bangladesh region consists of the delta of the Ganga & Brahmaputra , with its tidal estuaries , sandbanks , mud-flats , mangrove swamps & islands. Further upstream are lands drained , & occasionally flooded , by these great rivers & their tributaries. The north-east region also extends northwards to include all the forest regions of the states of Arunachal Pradesh , Mizoram , Meghalaya & Nagaland , as well as the Kinhdom of Bhutan. As you progress eastwards , the birdlife has increasingly strong affinities with the Indo-Chinese sub-region. </p>

	<p>Sri Lanka is a remarkable area for birdlife. Although far from large , the country has a wide range of climate & habitat which supports some 400 species  & sub-species of birds , including 21 species like the Ceylon Blue Magpie found nowhere else. Many of the island's birds are identical to these found in India , although for some reason vultures have not been able to cross the Palk Straits. sri Lanka can be divided into three zones , the dry plains of the north wet zone around the capital Colombo. The most useful detailed work exclusively dealing with Sri Lankan ornithology is GM Henry's A Guide to the Birds of Ceylon. </p>
