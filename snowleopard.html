<h2>Snow Leopard </h2>

<IMG height=149 alt="Snow Leopard" hspace=0 
src="../images/snowleopard2.jpg" 
width=180 align=right border=0><h3>¤ Know the Snow Leopards</h3><p>Even 
though sharing its name with the common leopard, the snow leopard is not 
believed to be closely associated to the Leopard or the other members of the 
Pantherine Family and is classified as the only member of the genus Uncia uncia. 
Due to the under-development of the fibro-elastic tissue that forms part of the 
vocal apparatus in the 'big cat' family, the snow leopard cannot give a full, 
deep roar and this along with differences in skull characteristics help to 
separate it from its fellow ‘big cats’. </p><h3>¤ The Physical 
Characteristics</h3><p>In appearance, the snow leopard is remarkably 
different from the common leopard. Although it has identical rosettes and 
broken-spot markings, they seem less well defined and have too much space 
between. The fur is long, woolly and heavy, which protects the cat from the 
extreme cold of its generally high altitude habitat. The general ground 
colouration of the cat is predominantly grey with brownish/yellow tinges on its 
flanks and lighter, often white fur on its belly, chest and chin. The head, 
which sports small ears and a distinct heavy brow, is rounded and comparatively 
small for its body size, which can be up to 1.3 meters length and weigh up to 
around 70kg. The long tail, which can measure as much as 900cm, helps the cat 
balance as it moves over rugged and often snowy terrain. The powerful limbs of 
the snow leopard are comparatively short for its body size and are supported by 
large, powerful paws. </p><p>The leopard's thick fur is about 5 cm long along 
the back - 10cm long underneath. The coat is a soft ashy-brown colour with black 
rosette markings. Body Length - 1.2 to 1.5m (4-5ft). Tail - 90cm (35.5ins). 
Weight: 25 - 75kg. The life-span of snow leopard is about 20 years in captivity. </p>
<h3>¤ Snow Leopard Habitat &amp; Diet </h3>
<p>The snow leopard generally inhabits elevations between 2000-4000 m, 
although it can occasionally be found at lower altitudes to the north of its 
range and as high as 5500 m in Himalayan regions. The cat is generally 
associated with generally rocky terrain such as high valley ridges, rocky 
outcrops and mountain passes. </p><p>The snow leopard lives in the remote 
mountainous regions of Central Asia, from Pakistan and Afghanistan to parts of 
Russia and China - including the lonely Altai Mountains and the Himalayas, where 
in summer it hunts at altitudes of up to 6,000 m (about 19,500ft). During the 
harsh winter weather, the snow leopard follows its prey and descends to lower 
lands of around 1,800 m (about 6,000ft). The prey species include wild sheep, 
marmots, and other rodents, hares and ground-dwelling birds.</p><p>Total area 
of its range is extremely large the actual areas in which the cat is found are 
relatively small and notably fragmented. This has led to disagreements amongst 
experts as to the subspeciation of the snow leopard. The cats found in the north 
of the range are generally classified as Uncia uncia uncia whilst those in the 
south, Uncia uncia uncioides. However some suggest that due to the fragmentation 
of the species within those broad areas, genetic differences may exist and 
further subspeciation may well be necessary. </p><p>

width=180 align=right border=0><B>Class : </B>Mammalia<BR><B>Zoological Name 
:</B> Panthera uncia <BR><B>Range :</B> Mountainous regions of northern India 
and in the Himalayas. <BR><B>Major Sites : </B>Nanda Devi National Park 
(Uttaranchal) , Hemis National Park (Jammu &amp; Kashmir), Dagchigam National 
Park (Jammu &amp; Kashmir). <BR><BR><h3>¤ Other Facts :</h3><p> Snow leopards 
are powerful, agile animals capable of making huge leaps to cross ravines or 
clear other obstacles. Usually a solitary creature, it leads a lonely life 
wandering the mountains, although the female leopard may be accompanied by cubs. 
These are born about 100 days after mating takes place, with two or three cubs 
in a litter. </p><p><h3>¤ Snow Leopards &amp; Conservation</h3><p>There are 
several reasons why the snow leopard is an endangered species. First and 
foremost, it has probably never existed in large numbers. It is solitary by 
nature and lives in a harsh, dangerous environment where a false step or 
misjudged leap could end in disaster. There is also danger from hunters, who 
kill the snow leopard for its beautiful coat of fur. Herdsmen kill snow leopards 
to protect their cattle and humans also affect the species by felling forests 
for cultivation or hydroelectric schemes.</p><p><h3>¤ The Present Status of Snow 
Leopards</h3><p>The total population of the snow leopard is now in hundreds 
rather than thousands. It has been fully protected in India since 1952. Urgent 
and decisive action to protect the snow leopard is the call of the hour, if this 
species is going to survive into the future generations. </p>
