<h2>Great Indian Elephant (Elephas Maximus)</h2>
<img src="../images/elephasmaximus.jpg" align ="right"/>
<p>This is one of the wild animals that has been granted a special status in Indian culture. Be it the temples of South India or the religious processions of North India; tribals of the North-east or the landlords of Bihar, you may find an elephant everywhere, though in much lesser numbers than earlier.<br>
Brought up in the wild and then caught and domesticated, the elephant, however close and friendly, has been a source of awe and wonder for human beings (surprisingly, even in this jet-age). </p>


<h3>¤ Difference Between African and Indian Elephant </h3>
<p>The Indian Asian elephant is much smaller in size than its African counterpart. Another distinctive difference is the length or absence of tusks. An average male elephant stands 240-300cm tall and can weigh a staggering 3600-5000kg. </p>

<h3>¤ Know the Indian Elephants</h3><p>The 
Indian elephant (Elephas maximus indicus) is a one of three subspecies of the 
Asian elephant ''Elephas maximus". The other two subspecies of the Asian 
elephant are E. m. sumatranus on Sumatra and E. m. maximus on Sri Lanka. The 
Indian elephant for example, is larger, has longer front legs and a thinner body 
as compared to other Asian elephants found in Thailand.</p><p>Through adaptive 
radiation, elephants until the Pleistocene Era (2 million years ago) had spread 
throughout the world except for Australia, New Zealand and Antarctica. Their 
majestic size was one factor in allowing this immense radiation and they could 
be found in a wide variety of habitats from desert to high mountain forest 
areas. They can easily move through swamps or climb mountainous terrain that is 
too difficult for a horse. </p>
<h3>¤ Physical Feature</h3>
<IMG height=149 alt="Indian Elephant" hspace=0 
src="../images/elephantbangalore.jpg" 
width=180 align=left border=0><p>The Asian elephant 
has been captured, tamed and worked by people for more than 4,000 years; it 
triggers the human imagination like no other animal. An average Indian elephant 
is anything between 2.4 m to 3 m tall, and weighs anything between 3,600 kg to 
5000 kg! Elephants in general are the largest existing land mammals and they 
have the biggest brains in the animal kingdom (weighing 5 kg or 11 lbs). Their 
hearts beat 28 times a minute. It also requires about 200 kg of green fodder, 
and due to dwindling habitat areas, there has been a drastic fall in their 
numbers. They are now an endangered species.</p><p><h3>¤ Key 
Factors</h3><p><B>Class : </B>Mammalia<BR><B>Indian Elephant : </B>Elephas 
maximus indicus<BR><B>Population :</B> India’s elephant population is estimated 
between 10,000 and 15,000, the largest in Asia. <BR><B>Major Sites : </B>About 
half of these are found in the northeastern states of Assam, 
Arunachal Pradesh and Meghalaya located in far northeastern India. </p>

<h3>¤ Characteristics</h3><p>The basic social 
structure is made up of a family group consisting of 2 to 10 females and their 
offspring. It has been found that groups of 3 or less adult females with 
offspring are more stable than larger groups. Young males start to move out of 
the family group between the ages of 6 and 7 years old. Young males mix up with 
each other in transitory groups until they reach adulthood. When they become 
full-grown males they live in solitude and only associate with a group when 
courting a female in estrus. </p><p>There are only two elephant species 
existing today - the African Elephant, and the Asian or Indian Elephant. The 
African species are bigger then the Indian one. Elephants live in a matriarchal 
society that are led by females in herds of 3 to 10, with 2-3 mature cows, 
calves and sub-adults all traverse together from one place to another in search 
of food. Adult males are separated from the herd as a <IMG height=149

width=180 align=right border=0>protection against inbreeding. The gestation 
period of elephants is very long, from between 19 to 21 months, and hence the 
birth rate is low. Also, there has to be a minimum interval of four years 
between two calves, and so the growth rate of the population is slow too. 
However, the life expectancy of an Indian Elephant is 70 to 80 years, and they 
are versatile creatures that adapt to diverse living conditions.</p><h3>¤ Habitat &amp; 
Diets</h3><p>The Asian elephant is found in the wild in Bangladesh, Bhutan, 
Cambodia, China, India, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, Nepal, Sri Lanka, 
Thailand and Vietnam. Asian elephants are randomly nomadic in accord with the 
season. Historically, they travel on a set course over longer periods that may 
take them as much as ten years to complete before arriving back at any one 
point. However, these travel patterns have been greatly reduced as fast-growing 
human populations now confine most elephants to National Parks because of 
habitat destruction and settlement encroachment.</p><p>They are found in a wide 
variety of forest types, but they tend to avoid large forests of closed 
canopies. Their distribution is limited by the need for water (about 100 liters) 
every day. Elephants are herbivores and spend up to 20 hours a day eating 
anywhere from 150 kg to 300 kg of jungle fodder or 6% to 8% of their body weight 
in food each day. They prefer feeding on grasses; however they also eat large 
amounts of bark, roots and leaves. Understandably, when elephants come across 
cultivated crops this food becomes addicting and as a result leads to human 
elephant confrontations. As far as cultivated foods, they seem to prefer rice, 
bananas and sugar cane. </p><h3>¤ Elephants &amp; Conservation</h3><p>The 
elephant population is vulnerable to unscrupulous poachers due to their precious 
ivory tusks. Elephant tusks can weigh up to 22 kg a pair. Elephants feed on 
barks, roots, fruit and grasses. The elephant population is now part of the 
Elephant Project, a nation wide conservation effort to protect these lumbering 
beasts from extinction. Manas, Corbett, Dalma and Palamu, Bandipur and 
Nagarhole, Periyar and Madumalai are the best places to watch the Indian 
Elephant in its natural habitat.</p>
