<h2>White Tiger </h2>
<p>
<IMG height=149 alt="White Tiger" hspace=0

width=180 align=right border=0><p>Tigers in general are the biggest 
cats in the world. They live in steamy hot jungles as well as icy cold forests. 
There are five different kinds or subspecies of tiger alive in the world today. 
These tigers are called Siberian, South China, Indochinese, Bengal, and 
Sumatran. Tigers are an endangered species; only about 5,000 to 7,400 tigers are 
left in the wild. Three tiger subspecies, the Bali, Javan, and Caspian tigers 
have become extinct in the past 70 years.</p><h3>¤ Physical Feature</h3><p>The 
tiger reaches up to 13 feet in size from nose to tail with the female being 
slightly smaller. They weigh approximately 500-700 pounds with the female being 
slightly smaller. Their lifestyle is solitary except when they breed. The mainly 
eat large animals such as antelope, deer, and oxen. The tigers lifespan is about 
10 years. The white tiger reaches sexual maturity at approximately 3 and a half 
to 4 years old. The mating is non-seasonal and they produce between 1 and six 
cubs.</p><h3>¤ Tiger Habitats &amp; Diets</h3><p>The tiger lives in varied 
habitats open jungles, humid evergreen forests and mango grove swamps. Tigers 
prefer thick grass, dense jungle and undergrowth in which they can hide and wait 
for their prey. The stripes on the hide of the tiger act as an incredible 
camouflage and help the tiger conceal itself in tall grass and vegetation. 
Tigers unlike other cats, like water and in the hot summer are often seen 
sitting or lying in pools of water to stay cool and are good swimmers.<br> 
Its diet consists mainly of deer, antelopes, gaurs and wild pigs. 
Sometimes it also captures birds, lizards, turtles, fishes, frogs and crabs. 
Tigers hunt on their own and usually lead a solitary existence, each in its own 
territory. They are blessed with good swimming power but seldom climb trees. Know The White Tigers<br>White tigers are basically a colour variant of the Bengal tiger and are rarely found 
in the wild. All white tigers in captivity in the world today are the 
descendants of one white tiger, Mohan caught by the Maharaja of Rewa in the year 
1951. A White Tiger is the same as a Royal Bengal Tiger except for a genetic 
mutation that causes the change in the colour of their fur and eyes. White 
tigers have blue eyes and brownish stripes.</p><h3>¤ Sites of White 
Tigers</h3><p>White tigers are only born when two tigers that both carry the 
unusual gene for white colouring mate. The white bengal tigers are mostly found 
in clumpy and forested areas where they can camouflage themselves. 
<BR><BR>Though, today white tigers are mostly confined in the zoos like Nandan 
Kanan in Orissa, they are also seen in Kanha National Park, Bandhavgarh National 
Park, Bandipur National Park, Ranthambore National Park, Manas Wildlife 
Sanctuary, Kaziranga National Park, Corbett National Park. </p><h3>¤ Key 
Factors</h3><p><B>Zoological name: </B>Panthera tigris tigris <BR><B>Origin 
:</B> "Mohan" the tiger found by the Maharaja Shri Martand Singh of Rewa in the 
year 1951.</p><h3>¤ Origin of The White Tigers</h3>


<IMG height=149 alt="White Tiger" hspace=0 src="../images/whitetiger4.jpg"
width=180 align=right border=0><p>In 1951, in central India, Maharaja Shri Martand 
Singh found a male white cub who's mother had been recently killed. He returned 
to his palace with the cub that he named "Mohan". The tiger soon became a bit of 
a celebrity.</p><p>When Mohan reached adulthood, he was bred to a normal tiger 
named "Begum". They produced three litters of cubs, but none of them were white. 
When Mohan was bred to one of his own daughters from the second litter however, 
four white cubs were born. One of these white cubs was named "Mohini" who was 
then bred to her uncle/half-brother "Sampson" and two of their offspring were 
sent to the National Zoo in Washington D.C. where they were bred to each other 
and produced, among other cubs, "Kesari" who was the foundation for the 
Cincinnati Zoo's line of white tigers....and this way the lineage continued. 
</p><p>In short, ALL of the white tigers you see in pictures are descendants of 
Mohan, and they are a close knit family (if you know what I mean). This includes 
the thirty-five or so "Royal White Tigers of Nevada" kept by Siegfried and Roy 
at The Mirage in Las Vegas.</p><h3>¤ The White Tigers in the Wilds</h3><p>White 
tigers are very hard to find in the wild. In about 100 years only a dozen white 
tigers have been seen in the wild in India. They are almost extinct and most of 
the ones living are in captivity, mostly in zoos. This specific tiger is not an 
albino or a seperate subspecies of the tiger. They are just white coloured and 
have black stripes. It has blue eyes and a pink nose. It also has white coloured 
fur. The white tiger is born to a bengal tiger that has the gene needed for 
white colouring. A pure white tiger has no stripes and are totally white. This 
is rare to find.</p><h3>¤ White Tigers &amp;Conservation</h3><p>Although 
white tigers are amazingly beautiful animals, they serve no conservation 
purpose, with the exception of increasing attendance to zoos. Thus increasing 
public awareness and education of the plight of all endangered animals. For this 
reason, the SSP (Species Survival Plan) coordinators for the various surviving 
subspecies of tiger do not authourize breeding the white tiger in their 
programs. Still this remarkable animal continues to bring hundreds of thousands 
of fascinated visitors to zoos and educational facilities across the world. 
Public awareness is the first step in conservation.</p>
