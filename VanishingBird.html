<h2>Vanishing Bird</h2>
<img src="../Images/ardeolagrayii.jpg" align ="left"/><p>One of the most significant & exciting achievements of Indian ornithology in recent years was the rediscovery of Jerdon's Courser in 1986 . In The Handbook of the Birds of India , Salim Ali said that the last ' authentic record was in 1900 , since when thorough search by competent ornithologists has failed to rediscover it '. Jerdon's  or Doublebanded Courser Rhinoptilus ( Cursorius ) bitorquatus was first recorded by Dr. TC Jerdon , an Indian Army Medical Officer , in 1848. Blandford recorded it in 1867 & 1871  & the last record was by Howard Campbell in 1900. Always rare bird , these few sightings were restricted to the Penner & Godavari river valleys of Andhra Pradesh , to the north-west of Madras. Despite surveys by outstanding ornithologists such as Whistler & Kinnear in 1929 & 1931 , by Salim Ali in 1932 & post-war surveys by the Bombay Natural History Sociaty ( BNHS ) along the Godavari river , no birds were sighted . Salim Ali , however , was not convinced . </p>

	<p>In 1985 , under a joint Government of India & US Government sponsered Endangered Species Project carried out by the BHNS , Bharat Bhushan , a young BNHS scientist , surveyed the dry scrub covered hill country where Jerdon first recorded the bird . In January 1986 , the species was rediscovered . </p> 

	<p>Jerdon's Courser is a nocturnal & crepuscular species found in open patches within scrub , bodering the dry decisuous forest of the region . Bharat Bhushan has identified six sites in the Lankamalai hills & suitable habitat in two valleys is restricted to about 2000 sq km . The timing of the rediscovery was providential as a month later it was realised that an irrigation scheme to take water from the large Nagarjunasagar lake to Madras would destory the area . A large channel would have been built through the exact discovery site . Fortunately , BHNS lobbyed hard & with support from the Andhra Pradesh Forest Department the State Government was able to realign the proposed canal . </p>

	<p>Since the rediscovery , the area has been gazetted as the Sri Lankamalleswara Wildlife Sanctuary covering 464 sq km . The sanctuary has an interesting policy of employing local tribs as protectors of the area . To the south the 353 sq km Sri Venkateswara National Park has been gazetted in the Palakonda forest area , while to the east there is a proposal too declare another 1300 sq km of the Velikonda forests as a Wildlife Sanctuary . All these areas are potential habitat for the courser but are also home to many other species including the golden gecko that was also rediscovered in the 1980s , the dwarf plam & the red sandalwood tree Perocarpus marsupium. </p>

	<p>Three other bird species that have not been recorded for the last seventy years are the Pink-headed Duck ( Rhodonessa caryophyllacea ) , the Himalayan Mountain Quail ( Ophrysia surciliosa ) & the Forest Spotted Owlet ( Athene blewitti ). Despite rumours as late as the 1960s , it seems the last Pink-headed Duck has been extinct in the wild since about 1926 . Originally thinly distributed through the wetlands , swamps & wilderness areas that formed around the confluence of the Ganga & Brahamputra rivers in the vast plains of Bengal & what is now Bangladesh . The reed beds along the river banks have longsince been cleared by the burgeoning human population & the isolated enclosed waters that were home to the ducks  have mostly disappeared . 
Little is known about the Pink-headed Duck & only a few skins exist in museum collection around the world . Local sportsmen hunted & shot the bird , but it was never popular eating . In the early years of this century a few birds would be regularly found in the markets of Calcutta but as these became les frequent naturalists began to become concerned . In 1924 an expendition scarched various areas of  Bengal but failed to see a single specimen . A few reports in the last fifty years may have confused this species with the Red-creasted Pochard ( Netta rufina ) with which it has a superficial resemblance . The Pink-headed & neck with a dull brown body except for a pink speculum . It is probable that the last living specimen died around 1935 in a private collection in England . </p>

	<p>Even less is known about the Himalayan Mountain Quail which was first reported in 1846 & has not been seen 1876 . Always a difficult bird to flush , Salim Ali belived a small population may have escaped detection in what remains of the forested mountain areas of the western Himalaya . The few specimens that collected during the last century were found between 1500 & 1850 meters in the hills around Mussoorie in Uttar Pradesh . The last specimen was collected near Nainital , a little further east . Judging by their thick , soft plumage it has been suggested that they spent the summers at much higher altitudes & only spent the winters in the Himalayan foothills . </p>

	<p>The third bird from the Indian sub-continent that has almost certainly become extinct in the last hundred years is the Forest Spotted Owlet . The last specimen was collected by the eccentric ornithologist Richard Meinertzhagen in October 1914 while on an expendition  alongthe Tapti river , north-east of Bombay , & near what is now the Melghat Tiger Reserve . The Owlet was apparently found in the heavy moist deciduous forests along the entire length of the Satpura mountains . Very little is known about its habits since the bird was first collected in 1873 . </p>

	<p>The rediscovery of Jerdon's Courser in 1986 vindicated Salim Ali's belief that the bird may have survived the enormous pressures placed on India's wilderness . He also hoped the Mountain Quail & Forest Owlet might be 'rediscovered' but despite efforts over the last ten years no reports have been received . It is however still possible thet the little known areas of the eastern ghats where the courser was found , may also yield a new bird to science . </p>
